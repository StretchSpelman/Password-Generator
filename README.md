# <Password-Generator>

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to add onto existing javascript code to create a website that generates a random password depending on user inputs.
- My motivation for this project was so I can better understand javascript since I am not that great with functions let alone math so this was a big challenge for me.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because if I or someone else was in need of a password this site would be able to give us that option.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and AI tools to give me a better understanding of things I just cant seem to grasp such as some terminology used inside of java script and, and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work, as well as using the developer tools inside of google chrome to troubleshoot and inspect things further.
